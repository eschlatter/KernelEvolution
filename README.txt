The following files are included:

(1) Folder (.tar.gz) "files_runsims"
     * Contains Matlab code (.m and .mlx files) for running model simulation data
       used for Figures 1-2 in the paper.
     * Contents:
	> 1_Preparation.mlx: runs function to create simulation environment: 2 x 512 habitable grid, surrounded by uninhabitable space

	> 2_Trajectories.mlx: runs functions to simulate evolutionary trajectories from 4 different initial displacement strategies, and for 3 levels of larval navigation (nmax=0, 1, and 2)

	> 3_NK_surfaces.mlx: generates a set of displacement strategies representing the entire range of possible distribution shapes. Then, for each element of the set, runs function to calculate nonviable habitat and kin competition costs in a population where all individuals share that strategy.

	> fn_create_env_bounded.m: function to create environment

	> fn_create_initial_pop.m: function to generate population data that can be used to initialize a simulation

	> fn_IBM_dispersal.m: function to run a simulation of the individual-based model

	> fn_many_costben_sim.m: runs the function to calculate nonviable habitat cost and kin competition many times, once for each of a set of displacement strategies.

	> fn_one_costben_sim.m: function to calculate nonviable habitat and kin competition costs for a population in which all individuals share the same displacement strategy, by simulating dispersal of a single generation of offspring.

	> NK_kernel_set.mat: data file containing the set of displacement strategies generated in 3_NK_surfaces.mlx

(2) Folder "output_environments"
     * Contains Matlab data file (.mat file) for the simulation environment

(3) Folder "output_simulations"
     * Contains Matlab data files (.mat files) for each individual-based
         simulation.
     * Contents:
 	> Folder "NK_surfaces" (data on kin competition and nonviable habitat costs for all displacement strategies in NK_kernel_set.mat. One file for each value of nmax = 0, 1, and 2.)

	> Folder "trajectories" (data on evolutionary trajectories for 4 initial displacement strategies x 3 values of nmax = 12 total simulations)

(4) Folder "files_plotsims"
     * Contains Matlab code (file 4_Plots.mlx) for plotting Figures 1-2 in the paper,
         using the above .mat files.

(5) Folder "figures"
     * Contains .png files of Figures 1a, 1b, 1c, and 2, generated by 4_Plots.mlx
